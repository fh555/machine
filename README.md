Machine
-------

Machine model that emulates a multi-tier storage hierarchy

# Levels

DRAM
NVM
SSD
HDD

LRU or ARC

# Parameters

sequential and random accesses separate parameters
read and write separate parameters

cost for reading from DRAM
cost for writing to DRAM

cost for reading directly from NVM
cost for writing directly to NVM
cost for reading from NVM to DRAM
cost for writing from DRAM to NVM

cost for reading from SSD to DRAM
cost for writing from DRAM to SSD
cost for reading from SSD to NVM
cost for writing from NVM to SSD

cost for reading from HDD to DRAM
cost for writing from DRAM to HDD
cost for reading from HDD to NVM
cost for writing from NVM to HDD

number of pages that fit in DRAM
number of pages that fit in NVM
number of pages that fit in SSD
number of pages that fit in HDD

# Durable pages: 

Must be written back to NVM/SSD/HDD

Table pages 
Index pages
Log pages
Checkpoint pages

# Ephemeral pages: 

Need not be written back to durable storage

Temporary table pages
Temporary memory allocations (logical tiles etc.)

# Init

Store ephemeral pages on DRAM
Store durable pages on both DRAM and NVM (copy in both DRAM and NVM)

SyncDurablePage()

Evict some durable pages from DRAM to NVM
EvictDurablePage() // No longer a cooy in DRAM

NVM is full => 
EvictDurablePage() // No longer a cooy in DRAM or NVM (stored in SSD)

SSD is full =>

EvictDurablePage() // No longer a cooy in DRAM or NVM (stored in HDD)

# Read a page

In DRAM
On NVM: can either directly read/write or copy it over to DRAM depending on frequency
On SSD/HDD: must copy it over to DRAM or NVM depending on frequency

# Write a page

Must exist in DRAM (ephemeral)
Must write to DRAM and durable storage (durable) (pick NVM/SSD/HDD based on frequency)

Minimize total time to complete operations

# Modules

LRU, LFU, and ARC caching algorithms
Multiple caches
Workload generator
